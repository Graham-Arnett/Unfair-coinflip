This is just a joke I made to see one way of how I could make something with random chance where one outcome is less common than any other outcome
Some applications of this sort of unbalanced random chance I think I want to experiment with would be a more advanced version of the turn based battle, using this to generate ranges of damage and critical hits for example, or if I had a program that was inspired by a card game. 
I want to practice switches more for that though since I feel it would be more readable than having a bunch of ifs for multiple options.
